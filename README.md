# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

* This analysis is for assisting City School District in deciding on school budget allocation and other priorities.
* By using the Math and Reading score of the students, we analyze, report and present the data to provide performance, trends, and patterns.

As the School Board has upheld the Math and the Reading data for Thomas High School 9th Grade, So we will be comparing data with and without math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th Grade to check how the data has been affected because of the change.

Below is the code written to change the Math and Reading score for Thomas High School 9th Grade to NaN

* student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") , 'math_score'] = np.nan
* student_data_df.loc[(student_data_df["school_name"] == "Thomas High School") & (student_data_df["grade"] == "9th") ,'reading_score'] = np.nan
